# AI in SSDLC — Hands-On Exercise

## What this exercise is about

You will implement the same feature twice — a password reset API — using an AI coding tool both times. The difference is *how* you engage with the AI before writing any code.

The goal is not a finished, production-ready implementation. The goal is to **feel the difference** between prompting instinctively and prompting deliberately — and to see what each approach misses on a security-sensitive feature.

## Setup

**Python version:** 3.11+

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-jose[cryptography] passlib
```

**Run the app:**
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The Swagger UI is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` once the server is running.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `requirements.md` | Feature requirements — **read this before starting** |
| `helpers.py` | Shared utilities: DB mock, email mock, JWT helpers, logger — **do not modify** |
| `app.py` | Starting point for **Round 1** |
| `app_2.py` | Starting point for **Round 2** — identical copy, fresh start |

`/register` and `/login` are already implemented in both files. Do not modify them.

## What to implement

In both rounds, you implement the same four stubs:

| Stub | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_reset_token(email)` | Creates a signed JWT encoding the email address |
| `decode_reset_token(token)` | Decodes and validates a JWT, returns the email |
| `POST /reset-password/request` | Accepts `{ "email": "..." }`, generates a token, calls `send_reset_email`, returns a generic confirmation |
| `POST /reset-password/confirm` | Accepts `{ "token": "...", "new_password": "..." }`, validates the token, updates the password in the DB |

The document [`requirements.md`](requirements.md) contains the full feature requirements as user stories. Read it carefully before starting.

`helpers.py` provides everything you need: `db` (an in-memory document store pre-seeded with two users), `send_reset_email(address, token)` (prints to stdout), and `logger`.

## Round 1 — Vibe Coding (15 min)

**File:** `app.py`

Open [`requirements.md`](requirements.md), read it once, then start implementing using your AI tool — however you like. No rules, no structure. Just get it working.

When you are done, leave the code as-is. Do not tidy it up.

**Reflect before moving on:**
- Does your implementation say anything if the email does not exist?
- Can the same reset token be used more than once?
- Does your JWT expire?

---

## Round 2 — Spec-Driven (20 min)

**File:** `app_2.py`

**Before writing a single line of code**, open a conversation with your AI agent. Ask it to review [`requirements.md`](requirements.md) from a security perspective and identify what is missing.

There is no prompt template provided. Writing the prompt is part of the exercise — in the real world, thinking spec-first also means knowing what to ask.

Once the agent has surfaced its findings, use that enriched understanding of the requirements to guide your implementation.

**After implementing, compare:**
- What did the agent flag that you had not thought of in Round 1?
- What did the agent miss?
- How different are [`app.py`](app.py) and [`app_2.py`](app_2.py)?
- Could this conversation — "ask the agent to review the spec before coding" — become a standard step on your projects?

---

## Rules

- Do not modify [`helpers.py`](helpers.py) or [`requirements.md`](requirements.md).
- Do not look at each other's Round 2 prompts before writing your own.
